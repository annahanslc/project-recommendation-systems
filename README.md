# Recommender System for Local Businesses

Imagine you're deciding where to eat, get your haircut, or spend a free afternoon—and instead of endlessly scrolling through Google reviews or sifting through star ratings, you have a trusted friend who knows your tastes recommending exactly the places you'd love.

That's the idea behind my recommender system for local businesses: a personalized experience that goes beyond generic ratings. By understanding your preferences, behaviors, and past favorites, it suggests businesses you're likely to enjoy—just like a friend who really gets you.

No more guesswork. Just the right place, every time.
